# Hangman Game

The Hangman Game is a classic word-guessing game implemented as an interactive web application. Players try to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a limited number of incorrect attempts (maximum 7 wrong guesses). The game provides real-time visual feedback by changing the wordâ€™s color to green when the player wins (correctly guesses the word), or to red when the player loses (exceeds the maximum wrong guesses).

This simple yet engaging game helps improve vocabulary and offers an enjoyable way to pass the time with clean, intuitive UI and responsive design.
